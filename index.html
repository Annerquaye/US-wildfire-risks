            <p>The <a href="https://wildfirerisk.org/about/">Wildfire Risk to Communities</a>, an initiative of the USDA Forest Service,
                provides resources that help communities explore wildfire risks.</p>
            <p>The initiative provides the data that allows communities to understand how wildfire risk varies across a
                state, region,
                or county, allowing them to prioritize actions to mitigate risk.</p>
            <p>The Wildfire Risk to Communities project, the USDA says, uses the best available science to find out
                which
                communities face imminent risk of wildfire, and intensity, among other risks.</p>
            <p>By making this data available, the USDA believes that it is empowering communities with
                the best resources to manage and mitigate these identifiable risks.</p>
            <p>The data shows housing units within counties exposed to wildfires.
                USDA explains exposure as the spatial coincidence of wildfire likelihood and intensity within
                communities.</p>
            <p>Generally, any community that is located where wildfire likelihood is greater than zero
                (in other words, where there is a chance wildfire could occur) is exposed to wildfire.</p>
            <p>A simple analysis of the Wildfire Risk to Communities <a href="https://wildfirerisk.org/download/">data</a> valid as of March 30, 2020 shows that West Virginia, 97.5%, has the most
                houses exposed to wildfire.
                The map below also shows a higher concentration of wildfire risk around the Eastern part of the country.
            </p>
            <p>Housing units in Illinois have the lowest wildfire risk, less than 30 percent.

            <p>The U.S. has sustained 323 weather and climate disasters, such as wildfires, since 1980 
            where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2022), according to the 
            National Centers for Environmental Information. 
            The total cost of these events exceeds $2.195 trillion.
        </p>
        <p>These events included droughts, floods, freeze events, severe storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires, and winter storms.</p>
            <p>In the last 42 years, Texas has been the most hit state by these disasters, incurring a cost of about $350bn.</p>
            <p>WHen the cost of wildfires as a percentage of the total cost of these weather and climate disasters by state,
                Alaska proportion comes up to 100% while California, which has storied history with wildfires comes in second with nearly 70%.
            </p>
